🚀 Day 1 of My 30 Days of AWS + Terraform Journey

What is Infrastrucre as code ?
- Code that provide or provising Infrastrucre is known as Infrastrucre as code .

tools for Iac
- Terraform - Multicloud King
- AWS - cloudformation, AWS CDK (cloud development kit)
- GCP - Cloud Deployment Manager
- Azure - ARM templete | Bicep

why we need Iac ?
-Avoid hunman error
-with its faster 
-consistency across env -> Without IaC: Dev, QA, and Prod environments may not match.
With IaC: All environments are identical, because they come from the same code.
-Infrastrucre become version control by pushing code in git
- Cost Optimisation -> have idea how much infra is created and using
- Easy to scale or replicate
- easy for automation / CICD
- Disaster recovery become easy

how Terraform help?
along with above IaC benifits it is widely used in industry.
- support Multicloud like AWS,GCP,Azure even on premisis cloud also
-use simple language to write code HCL 
- Track changes with state file
-Dependency Management -> Terraform automatically understands resource order.
- easy to destroy -> which save cost

How Terraform works?
